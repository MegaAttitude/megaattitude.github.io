title: The MegaIntensionality Dataset
handle: megaintensionality
---

Much recent work in the formal semantics literature attempts to relate lexically triggered
inferences to predicates' intensional properties. In particular, the properties of a predicate
related to belief or desire of one or both participants give rise to doxastic and
bouletic inferences, respectively. For example, (1a) gives rise to the inference (2a), while
(1b) gives rise to the inference (2b).

1. 
   a. Jo knew that Bo left.<br/>
   b. Jo liked that Bo left.

2. 
   a. Jo believed that Bo left.<br/>
   b. Jo wanted Bo to have left.

These inferences are of particular interest due to the patterns that emerge in how the
inferences are affected by contexts such as negation. Doxastic and bouletic inferences
are said to be "foregrounded" if they are at-issue and targeted by negation, and "backgrounded"
if they are insensitive to negation. For example, while (3a) gives rise to the inference (4a),
(3b) gives rise to (2a), suggesting that the doxastic inference for *like* is backgrounded.
In contrast, the bouletic inference in this case is foregrounded, as evidenced by the fact that
(3b) gives rise to (4b). The question of which correlations between these properties (and
other lexical properties) are possible has received considerable attention in recent work.

The MegaIntensionality dataset consists of ordinal acceptability judgments for 725 finite clause-embedding verbs of English with a variety of subordinate clause structures, matrix tenses, and matrix subjects.
