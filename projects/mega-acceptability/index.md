It has long been assumed that a verb’s syntactic distribution is
determined by at least two kinds of lexical information: (i) the
verb’s semantic type signatures and (ii) its morphosyntactic
features. The first of these is often termed S(emantic)-selection; the
second goes under various names, though perhaps the most neutral term
is subcategorization. Standard distributional analyses in the
theoretical literature have had tremendous success in uncovering the
nature of S-selection and its relationship to the syntax—i.e.
projection rules. But as theories scale to the entire lexicon, these
approaches hit a limit, imposed by the sheer size of lexica and by
bounds on human analysts’ memory and processing power. This challenge
suggests the need for *lexicon-scale* datasets.

For a detailed description of the datasets associated with this
project, the item construction and collection methods, and discussion
of how to use a dataset on this scale to address questions in
linguistic theory, please see the references below.
