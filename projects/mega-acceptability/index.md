It has long been assumed that a verb’s syntactic distribution is determined by
at least two kinds of lexical information: (i) the verb’s semantic type
signatures and (ii) its morphosyntactic features. The first of these is often
termed S(emantic)-selection ; the second goes under various names, though
perhaps the most neutral term is subcategorization. Standard distributional
analyses in the theoretical literature have had tremendous success in uncovering
the nature of S-selection and its relationship to the syntax—i.e., projection
rules. But as theories scale to the entire lexicon, these approaches hit a
limit, imposed by the sheer size of lexica and by bounds on human analysts’
memory and processing power. This challenge suggests the need for
*lexicon-scale* datasets.

The MegaAcceptability dataset consists of ordinal acceptability judgments for
1,000 clause-embedding verbs of English in 50 surface-syntactic frames and with
three different matrix tense-aspect. For a detailed description of the dataset,
the item construction and collection methods, and discussion of how to use a
dataset on this scale to address questions in linguistic theory, please see the
