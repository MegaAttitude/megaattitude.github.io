Which aspects of semantic interpretation are due to predicatesâ€™ denotations and
which are due to the denotations of their arguments? One way to approach this
issue is examining clause-embedding verbs in the context of temporal
interpretation, which acts as an indicator of underlying syntactic
structures and semantic frames. For example, in (1), is it a fact about a verb
like *regret* or a fact about its subordinate clause that explains why the
leaving can be yesterday but not tomorrow? Is it the same for *want* in (2)?

(1) a. #Jo regretted leaving tomorrow.<br/>
    b.  Jo will regret leaving yesterday.

(2) a. Jo wanted to leave tomorrow.<br/>
    b. #Jo will want to leave yesterday.

One reason this question is difficult to answer is that a change in embedded
clause structure sometimes alters the relevant pattern. For example, in (3a),
*remember* patterns like *regret*, but in (3b), it patterns like *want*. In
both, *remember* takes a participial (-ing) clause, unlike (1) and (2).

(3) a. Jo will remember leaving yesterday.<br/>
    b. #Jo will remember to leave yesterday.

Is this an idiosyncratic fact about the verb *remember* or a general fact about
the structure of its complements?

The MegaOrientation dataset consists of ordinal acceptability judgments for 898
clause-embedding verbs of English with a variety of nonfinite subordinate clause
structures. A detailed description of the dataset is coming soon.
