## Overview

This MegaNegRaising dataset consists of neg-raising judgments and acceptability judgments for 925 clause-embedding verbs of English in six surface-syntactic frames.  The data were collected on Amazon's Mechanical Turk using [Ibex on Mechanical Turk](https://github.com/aaronstevenwhite/ibex).

For a detailed description of the dataset, the item construction and collection methods, and discussion of how to use a dataset on this scale to address questions in linguistic theory, please see the following paper:
