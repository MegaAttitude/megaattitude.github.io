Inferences that are triggered (at least in part) by particular lexical items
provide a rich test bed for distinguishing the relative semantic contribution of
lexical items and functional structure. One class of such inferences that has
garnered extended attention is neg(ation)-raising, wherein negation on a
predicate can be interpreted as though in that predicate’s subordinate clause.
For example, a neg-raising inference is triggered by (1) while one is not
triggered by (2).

(1) Jo doesn’t think that Bo left.
    ~~> Jo thinks that Bo didn’t leave.

(2) Jo doesn’t know that Bo left.
    ~/~> Jo knows that Bo didn’t leave.

The MegaNegRaising dataset (MegaNeRd) consists of slider-based veridicality
judgments aimed at capturing patterns like that in (1) and (2) as well as
ordinal acceptability judgments for 925 clause-embedding verbs of English with a
variety of subordinate clause structures, matrix tenses, and matrix subjects.
For a detailed description of the dataset, the item construction and collection
methods, and discussion of how to use a dataset on this scale to address
questions in linguistic theory, please see the following paper:
