title: The MegaVeridicality Dataset
handle: megaveridicality
---

The formal semantics literature has long been concerned with the complex array
of inferences that different open class lexical items trigger. For example, why
does (1a) give rise to the inference (2a), while the structurally identical (1b)
triggers the inference (2b)?

1. 
   a. Jo doesn’t believe that Bo left.<br/>
   b. Jo doesn’t know that Bo left.

2. 
   a. Jo believes that Bo didn’t leave.<br/>
   b. Bo left.<br/>
   c. Bo didn’t leave.

A major finding of this literature is that lexically triggered inferences are
conditioned by surprising aspects of the syntactic context that a word occurs
in. For example, while (3a), (3b), and (4a) trigger the inference (2b), (4b)
triggers the inference (2c).

{:start="3"}
3. 
   a. Jo remembered that Bo left.<br/>
   b. Jo didn’t remember that Bo left.

4. 
   a. Bo remembered to leave.<br/>
   b. Bo didn’t remember to leave.
