The formal semantics literature has long been concerned with the complex array
of inferences that different open class lexical items trigger. For example, why
does (1a) give rise to the inference (2a), while the structurally identical (1b)
triggers the inference (2b)?

(1) a. Jo doesn’t believe that Bo left.<br/>
    b. Jo doesn’t know that Bo left.

(2) a. Jo believes that Bo didn’t leave.<br/>
    b. Bo left.<br/>
    c. Bo didn’t leave.

A major finding of this literature is that lexically triggered inferences are
conditioned by surprising aspects of the syntactic context that a word occurs
in. For example, while (3a), (3b), and (4a) trigger the inference (2b), (4b)
triggers the inference (2c).

(3) a. Jo remembered that Bo left.<br/>
    b. Jo didn’t remember that Bo left.

(4) a. Bo remembered to leave.<br/>
    b. Bo didn’t remember to leave.

The MegaVeridicality dataset consists of ordinal veridicality judgments as well
as ordinal acceptability judgments for 773 clause-embedding verbs of English
with a variety of subordinate clause structures. For a detailed description of
the dataset, the item construction and collection methods, and discussion of how
to use a dataset on this scale to address questions in linguistic theory, please
